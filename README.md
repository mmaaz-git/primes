# Prime testing algorithms

A repository where I am experimenting with different primality tests

Currently implemented:
- Agrawal-Biswas (https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/manindra/algebra/identity.pdf)
- Lucas-Lehmer, for prime testing of numbers of the form 2^n-1 (n prime)

TODO:
- Miller-Rabin
- AKS

See `benchmarks.txt` for some benchmarks. I've checked some decently large primes. Still could optimize more.
